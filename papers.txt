O ancient ones, hear our cry,
The beast returns beneath dark sky.
Spare our homes, our kin, our land—
Send us strength, or guiding hand.
To drive Nian away, one must hang
red at every door, light lanterns
through the night, and fill the air
with the crackle of firecrackers.
It fears brightness, boldness, and
noise. Those who stand united will
see the dawn.
Nian is a fearsome beast with horns
 like knives and eyes that burn like
 fire. It awakens each year to bring
 destruction upon villages, feeding
 on fear and silence. No wall or weapon
 can hold it back—only ancient wisdom can.
