O ancient ones, hear our cry, \nThe beast returns beneath dark sky. \nSpare our homes, our kin, \nour land—Send us strength, \nor guiding hand.
To drive Nian away, one must \nhang red at every door, light lanterns \nthrough the night, and fill \nthe air with the crackle of firecrackers. \nIt fears brightness, boldness, and noise. \nThose who stand united will see the dawn.
Nian is a fearsome beast with \nhorns like knives and eyes that burn \nlike fire. It awakens each year \nto bring destruction upon villages, \nfeeding on fear and silence. No wall \nor weapon can hold it back—\nonly ancient wisdom can.
